                            <p>While we don't know what all of the upcoming anime in 2023 will be, it's never too early to get hyped about the amazing series that have already been announced. 

                                So far, 2023 looks like it will be as incredible a year for anime as 2022 was. Plenty of beloved series are getting sequels, including Vinland Saga, Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, Bungo Stray Dogs, and more. 
                                
                                But 2023 is bringing more than just sequels - there are also a ton of great series that you need no experience to dive right into. For romance fans, there's My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999. Love an underdog story? Try Mashle. Obsessed with old school anime? You might be interested in Trigun Stampede, a reboot of the classic 90s series.
                                
                                Which 2023 anime are you most looking forward to?</p>

                            <h4 style="color: red;">Jujutsu Kaisen (Season 2) </h4>
                            <img src="img/blog/details/JJK.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Jujutsu Kaisen is an excellent modern shonen that's worth getting caught up on if you haven't yet. After getting possessed by a Cursed Spirit named Sukuna, Yuji Itadori now attends Jujutsu High School, where he learns how to fight curses and use his new powers for good. Should he fail, he risks being executed. 

                                Season 1 concluded with a battle between Yuji, his friends, and the dangerous Cursed Womb paintings. It's not clear yet which parts of the manga will be adapted, but there are plenty of exciting moments coming up, including a peek into Yuji's teacher Gojo's past, and the rise of a villain who could threaten the entire world.</p>

                            <p>Attack on Titan's most recent cour ended on a terrifying note. Believing that there was no other way to achieve freedom for the Eldian people, Eren has decided to destroy everybody else on Earth. His friends are desperately trying to stop him, but so far, their attempts seem hopeless.

                                In the upcoming cour, fans who haven't read the manga will finally get to learn how things play out - and those who have read it get to see the end in all of its animated glory.</p>

                            <p>Bungo Stray Dogs is back again with its fourth season. The Armed Detective Agency is a group of people with supernatural powers who solve mysteries and fight against enemies like the Port Mafia and the Guild.

                                Every character - and every supernatural power - is based on a famous author or famous piece of writing. It's the perfect anime for literature nerds who also love high-octane mystery anime.</p>

                            <p>Black Clover is a popular modern shonen that follows Asta, a young man who wants to become the Wizard King even though he lacks any magical ability. The anime is getting a movie: Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King.

                                This story will focus on a conflict between Asta and his friends and the former Wizard King, Conrad Leto, who appears to have taken possession of the “Emperor's Sword.” If you love Black Clover, then you shouldn't miss this film. </p>

                            <img src="img/blog/details/MT.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>The lauded but controversial isekai Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation will be returning in 2023. A depressed, lonely shut-in is at rock bottom when he suddenly passes away and is reincarnated as Rudeus Greyrat, a newborn baby who will grow up to have incredible powers.

                                This sounds like a run-of-the mill isekai series, but it stands out because of its excellent art and detailed storytelling. It also stands out because of its intense, sometimes disturbing fan service. It's a series that you might want to approach with caution, but if you liked the first season, you'll probably like the second one, too.</p>

                            <p>After every human on earth was encased in stone for thousands of years, the world reverted to a wild state. When scientific genius Senku Ishigami wakes up, he's determined to bring back the technological wonders that defined the modern age. With help from other people who have been revived and a village full of the descendants of some of the only surviving humans, he manages to do just that. Last season, he took on Tsukasa, the leader of a group who wants to prevent technological developments and the full revival of humankind. 

                                With Tsukasa now on his side, Senku has a new mission - to find the source of the phenomenon that turned them all into stone to begin with.</p>

                            <p>After her family rejected her because of her powers as a Sleigh Beggy, Chise Hatori is so desperate that she ends up putting herself up for auction. Her buyer is Elias Ainsworth, a cow-skulled man who wants to help her train her powers - oh, and marry her if she's okay with it.

                                Season 1 is dedicated to Chise's growth from a depressed, timid person who did whatever she was told to a self-actualized, powerful young woman who stands up for herself and her desires - even if that means risking her safety. It's also about the magical world around her, and the development of her relationship with Elias. 
                                
                                Having come to an understanding with Joseph, the first season's villain, Chise is now ready for her next adventure.</p>

                            <p>Just because your boyfriend is a gamer doesn't mean that he'll be loyal. Akane Kinoshita finds that out the hard way when her boyfriend cheats on her with somebody he met in-game. While drowning her sorrows by defeating mob bosses, she has her own in-game encounter - a guildmate whose character wears a Noh mask and an afro.

                                This guildmate, Akito Yamada, is far from friendly. Despite her better judgment, Akane Kinoshita finds herself wanting to pull him out of his shell. Can she possibly get through to him?</p>

                            <p>Naoto is a reclusive nerd who sees the popular girls in his school as practically another species. Having one of them pay attention to him is a terrifying prospect, but that's exactly what happens when Nagatoro, a popular underclassman, decides to start teasing him mercilessly.

                                At first it just seems like straightforward bullying, but as the series progresses, it seems like there might be a little bit more to Nagatoro's intentions. Meanwhile, Naoto doesn't completely hate Nagatoro. Season 2 will continue exploring their strange relationship.

Because of this totally unexpected development, he gets to learn what the world of idols is truly like from the inside.

                            <p>Tokyo Revengers follows a twenty-something man named Takemichi Hanagaki as he repeatedly travels backwards in time and inhabits his childhood self in order to save his ex-girlfriend Hina from losing her life to gang violence. To do that, he has to get close to the gang's higher-ups. He soon realizes that there are a lot more people he wants to save than just Hina - and that doing so will be far more difficult than he thought. 

                                Season 2 follows the Christmas Showdown Arc, which involves a battle between the Tokyo Manji Gang and the 10th Generation Black Dragon.</p>
